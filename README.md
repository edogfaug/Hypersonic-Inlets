#
How to use:

Final 2 codes for submission are tabbed with 'Finished code' and both serve different purposes.
#
To use inlet optimizing code with no computational resource contraints
  use the 'angle optimization with adaptive neural network' code
#	
To use inlet optimization with computational resource contraints (slight accuracy loss)
  use the 'angle optimization with neural network condensor' code
